# Word Count Program in C

This program is designed to count the number of characters, words, and lines in a C file.

## How it Works

The program opens a specified C file, iterates through each character, and keeps track of the number of characters, words, and lines based on certain conditions:
- Characters: Counts every character in the file.
- Words: Identifies words by detecting spaces, tabs, and newlines.
- Lines: Counts the number of newline characters encountered.
